# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! A classic game where you navigate your snake to consume food, grow in size, and achieve the highest score possible while avoiding dangers and your own growing tail.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Press the **Start** button to begin.
2. **Navigate the Snake:** Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) on your keyboard to move the snake.
3. **Eat the Food:** Navigate the snake towards the food element to grow your snake's tail.
4. **Grab the Bonus:** Spot the bonus element? Grab it! Not only will it increase your snake's tail but also give it a bonus speed.

## Tips

1. As your snake grows, navigation becomes trickier. Plan your movements in advance.
2. The bonus speed from the bonus element can be both a boon and a bane. Use it wisely!
