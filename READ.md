Hello there! Welcome to my modern take on the classic Snake game. Crafted with love using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this game combines nostalgia with fresh new features, sure to keep you entertained. A little splash of Bootstrap and a quirky GIF from Kong Studio brings this game to life!

How to Play
Get Started: Just click on that "Start" button and watch your snake spring to life.

Control the Snake: The goal is simple. Guide the snake around the board using your arrow keys.

Don't Bite Yourself!: The game ends if your snake hits the board's edges or decides to snack on its own tail.

Spice Things Up: We have added:

Food: Grab these to increase your snake's length.
Bonus Speed: Looking for a challenge? These speed boosts make things zippy!
Danger Boxes: Keep away! Or learn the hard way.
Score High: The longer you play, the more points you accumulate. Food and bonus items fetch you extra points. How high can you score?

Future Aspirations
Dreaming big! Imagine a world where two or more players can wriggle around, competing in an expanded playground. It would be amazing if we could introduce a multiplayer mode in the near future.

Acknowledgments

Thanks to Kong Studio for the snazzy GIF that gives our game its unique charm.
