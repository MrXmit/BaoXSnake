# Hello there!

Welcome to my modern take on the classic **Snake game**. Crafted with love using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this game combines nostalgia with fresh new features, sure to keep you entertained. A little splash of Bootstrap and a quirky GIF from Kong Studio brings this game to life!

## How to Play

- **Get Started:** Just click on that "Start" button and watch your snake spring to life.
- **Control the Snake:** The goal is simple. Guide the snake around the board using your arrow keys.
- **Don't Bite Yourself!:** The game ends if your snake hits the board's edges or decides to snack on its own tail.
- **Spice Things Up:** We have added:
  - **Food:** Grab these to increase your snake's length.
  - **Bonus points:** Looking for a challenge? These bonus points boosts your score.
  - **Danger Boxes:** Keep away! Or learn the hard way.
- **Score High:** The longer you play, the more points you accumulate. Food and bonus items fetch you extra points. How high can you score?

## Future Aspirations

Dreaming big! Imagine a world where two or more players can wriggle around, competing in an expanded playground. It would be amazing if we could introduce a multiplayer mode in the near future.

## Acknowledgments

- A big shoutout to Bootstrap for making the UI sleek.
- Thanks to Kong Studio for the snazzy GIF that gives our game its unique charm.

**So, I have a coding buddy named Bao, and she's a little Chihuahua!** That's just delightful.

> "Bao" is a name that finds its roots in various cultures. In Mandarin Chinese, "Bao" (ÂåÖ) translates to "bun" or "package", which could refer to something small and precious - much like your pint-sized coding companion! Bao can also mean "treasure" or "precious" in Mandarin, which, let's be honest, is a fitting description for a furry friend that keeps you company during those long coding sessions.

And if coding with a Chihuahua named Bao isn't **#CodingGoals**, I don't know what is! Give Bao a little scratch behind the ears for me and thank her for her invaluable contributions. Every coder needs a sidekick, after all! üòÑüêïüíª

**Happy Playing! üéÆ**
